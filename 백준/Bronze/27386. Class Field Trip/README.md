### 문제 설명

<p>Instructors ann and ben firmly believe that everything should be alphabetical, especially names. (They also don't believe in capital letters!) They take alphabetical order to such an extreme that they even order the letters of their names when listed together. For example, the last time they co-taught they listed the instructors as <code>abennn</code>! They are taking their classes on a class field trip, so they need to merge their lists of students. Fortunately, they each have their student lists in order, so merging the lists should be quick. If ann has <code>john</code> and <code>amy</code> in her class and ben has <code>jack</code> and <code>jill</code> in his class, their two lists would be <code>ahjmnoy</code> and <code>acijjkll</code>. The field trip list would be <code>aachijjjkllmnoy</code>. </p>

<p>Given ann's and ben's lists, produce the field trip list.</p>
